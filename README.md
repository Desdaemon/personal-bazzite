## Building The Image

### `just build`

```

Arguments:
- `$target_image`: The tag you want to apply to the image (default: `$image_name`).
- `$tag`: The tag for the image (default: `$default_tag`).

## Building and Running Virtual Machines and ISOs

```

### `just run-vm-qcow2`

Runs a virtual machine from a QCOW2 image.

```bash
just run-vm-qcow2 $target_image $tag
```

### `just spawn-vm`

just spawn-vm rebuild="0" type="qcow2" ram="6G"
```

## Additional resources

For additional driver support, ublue maintains a set of scripts and container images available at [ublue-akmod](https://github.com/ublue-os/akmods). These images include the necessary scripts to install multiple kernel drivers within the container (Nvidia, OpenRazer, Framework...). The documentation provides guidance on how to properly integrate these drivers into your container image.
